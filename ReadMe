Implemented an expense sharing application where users can split and settle their expenses either individually or as a group.
The application takes input through a command line.
Used spring-boot in craeting different models and mapping them as per their cardinality
I implemented the entire project using a MySQL database and used JDBC to connect it with the main application.
used a strategy design pattern while creating different settle-up strategies.
Implemented two different settle-up strategies. One using arrays and the other using min and max heaps.
Followed all the design patterns and created DTOs, models, repositories,services and controllers.
